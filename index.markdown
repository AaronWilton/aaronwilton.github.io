This IPT extension demonstrates how Local Context Projects, Labels and Notices could potentially be included in a structured way within resources being published to the GBIF network. If endorsed, this may provide an interim or specific solution for the provision of Local Contexts information with occurrences.

For information on Local Contexts and the tools they provide please visit their site at [https://localcontexts.org/](https://localcontexts.org/).

This work is a contribution to the GBIF pilot aiming to integrate Local Contexts Notices and Labels within GBIF publishing frameworks. For details about the pilot see [https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-publishing/local-contexts-pilot](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-publishing/local-contexts-pilot)

**Note**:  this extension and the included terms - and all of the properties of the terms - are for demonstration purposes.  This extension may be removed or updated without notice.  It **must not** be considered a stable or endorsed vocabulary or extension for IPT.
