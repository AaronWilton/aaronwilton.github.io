This is a demonstration of an IPT extension for Local Context Labels and Notices.

It explorers the use case of an occurrence record (and potentially a sampling event record) connecting to one or more Local Context Projects.

There are two specific scenarios that can be demonstrated with this.  
- a minimalist approach, only providing the Project ID
- a balanced approach providing also providing some data that will assist searching or display of the data as it will not require resolving the project id to obtain necessary parameters.


The use case of a maximial extension to support archiving of datasets with complete information is not covered in this demonstration at this point.
